# React Parallax Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This demo project was a one-day task created using React and the React-spring animation library.

The project is my first dive into React, React-spring.

  

## Outstanding tasks

-   Add the loading screen, so the page starts at the bottom.
- Add alt tags to images
-   Page doesn't scroll if the mouse is positioned over the rocket.
-   Rocket requires proper animation (currently animated with CSS). I'd like to have an appropriate animation for the engine flames and propulsion.
-   Rocket is present on page load. The rocket should appear in the proper location (at the bottom of the page)
-   Componentatize the parallax. The app.js file is quite DRY; I feel there's a better way to handle this in react, and the current implementation isn't a standardised approach.
-   Add more to the ground, trees, grass etc.
-   Tests
-   Cleanup resources from the 'Create React App' (favicon etc)

  

## What went well

-   Creating the react app was straight forward
-   Clear documentation, easy to implement the spring library
-   Position images within the parallax didn't take long
-   Tesla roadster with a waving Starman <br>

## Thoughts

-   Not sold on the idea the user has to click a button to auto scroll to the bottom, to then scroll up. Maybe this should have just been a keyframe animation instead; The loading screen may help with this a bit.
-   The parallax configuration seems basic, I wasn't able to see an easy way of introducing horizontal parallax layers within the vertical parallax. I'm sure with more time, I'd find a solution to this.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
